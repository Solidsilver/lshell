Need to provide:
1) & (background process)
    - 
2) | Multiple pipes (recursive vs other method for doing this?)
3) PATH extension
4) read from .usshrc on startup (batch file). (Allow Batch file to be read as a set of commands?)
    read PATH and HISTCOUNT and HISTFILECOUNT from batch file
5) History file .ussh_history (read from and write to upon exit);
    - create a LinkedList to hold every current history item.
6) Aliasing (alias SOMETHING='somethingelse') and unaliasing
    - LinkedList holding the alias name and it's value. Substitute in before execution. (after makeargs)
7) Redirection: < > >> <<
8) CD using chdir.

In order of precident, the main method will:
    Before commands:
1) read .usshrc and .ussh_history
2) initialize defaults if not found
    Command Processing
1) Check for | or & (maybe && or ||) and seperate out execution of commands.
2) Parse each command and replace $VAR's, and aliases (if they are the actuall program name. args[0]);
3) Check variable declaration/assignment (ex. PATH)
4) Check if command is a builtin, and run self-definition.
5) if not a builtin, run command, handling forking and possible piping/background run.


Updated order of precident?:
