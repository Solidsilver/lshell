Stu's Testing File & how testing will be conducted
1) Delete .usshrc & .ussh_history (MUST SILL RUN)

Tests they run:
    history
    ls
    pwd
    ls -(opts)
    //other basic commands
    end with history, then exit
    check .ussh_history to ensure commands are saved


2) Run it again: miss .usshrc

    history (should see commands read from hist);
    //basic commands again.

3) Create .usshrc with COUNT=5, FILECOUNT=10;
    history (should only see last 5 commands);

//POSSIBLE 25 POINTS so far

4) recreate .usshrc with COUNT=10 and FILECOUNT=5
 - NOTE: FILECOUNT is only for writing to file (how many of the last commands to add to file).
         COUNT is for how many to display when running 'history'. 
         You will load the entire file every time.

    Test all commands, basically:
    !!, |(+1), &, <, >, >>, cd, history, alias/unalias

//POSSIBLE 85 so far

5) Weird stuff - 10 point one-off
ex.
!! | wc -w
!513 | wc - w
./a.out < whatever.txt > helpme.txt &

//POSSIBLE 95

valgrind: 5 points (unless REALLY bad, +2000 bytes);
